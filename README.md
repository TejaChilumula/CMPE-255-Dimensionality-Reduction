# CMPE-255-Dimensionality-Reduction

This repository showcases various techniques for dimensionality reduction using Python libraries like Scikit-Learn and Spark's MLlib in Databricks.

## Introduction ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Dimensionality reduction is a crucial step in machine learning pipelines. This repository provides examples and code snippets demonstrating how to perform dimensionality reduction on different datasets.

## Techniques Used üõ†Ô∏è

### Scikit-Learn
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
- UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)

### Spark's MLlib (in Databricks)
- PCA for large-scale data processing

## Folder Structure üìÇ

- `Scikit-Learn`: Contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating dimensionality reduction using Scikit-Learn.
- `Databricks`: Includes code snippets for dimensionality reduction in Databricks notebooks.
- `Datasets`: Dataset files used for analysis.

## How to Use üöÄ

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the `Scikit-Learn` and `Databricks` folders for code examples.
3. Download the datasets from the `Datasets` folder to replicate the analysis.
